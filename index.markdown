    <p>Welcome to my homepage! I am a 6th year PhD Candidate at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ashleefordversypt/">Ashlee Ford Versypt Lab</a>, in the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science.html">Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</a>, University at Buffalo, SUNY.</p>
    <p>My PhD research is focused on building Computational Multiscale Modeling of Metastatic Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion. I employ mathematical models, machine learning models, and data science techniques in my investigation and research. I spend the summer of 2022, and 2023 with JPMorgan Chase & Co. as an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Summer Associate.
